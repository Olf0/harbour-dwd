# harbour-dwd

A german weather service app for  SailfishOS. 

The service at brightsky.dev creates an easy to use json api to get at the data. I wrap that with QML.

We also include a rainviewer html Radar view (WebView) from https://rainviewer.com

https://brightsky.dev/demo for a web demo and https://github.com/jdemaeyer/brightsky/ for the source.

This is still a simple project to test QML programming and network api usage/access.
